 Fluid simulation in Unity

I created Fluid simulation in Unity with help of Sebastian Lague's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE) on fluid simulation to learn HLSL and graphics pipeline in Unity as well as GPU architecture.<br />
This is solely for educational purpose.

## To-do
- I'll add rendering fluid to make it seem like water next.
- Optimization for better performance.

These are the references Sebastian Lague shared in his video that made me understand better. <br />
